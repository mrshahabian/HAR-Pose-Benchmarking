# Jetson-specific requirements file
# This file excludes packages that are pre-installed on Jetson devices
# to allow the virtual environment to use system PyTorch with CUDA support

# IMPORTANT: Constrain NumPy to <2.0 for compatibility with system PyTorch
# System PyTorch was compiled against NumPy 1.x
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0

# Core dependencies that need to be installed
ultralytics>=8.0.0
pynvml>=11.5.0
tqdm>=4.65.0
pillow>=10.0.0

# ONNX Runtime (CPU version only - GPU version not available for ARM64)
onnx>=1.14.0
onnxruntime>=1.15.0

# System packages that will be inherited via --system-site-packages:
# - torch (Jetson-optimized with CUDA support)
# - torchvision (Jetson-optimized)
# - opencv (Jetson-optimized)
# - numpy
# - pandas
# - matplotlib
# - seaborn
# - pyyaml
# - psutil
# - scipy

# Note: Do NOT install opencv-python as it will conflict with system OpenCV
# Note: Do NOT install torch/torchvision as system versions have CUDA support
